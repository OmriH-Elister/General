# General
This repository mainly contains scripts I've written which main function is:
1) Receive a folder path from the user as input.
2) Enumerate said folder recursively (Including all of it's subfolders, their own subfolders, etc.)
3) For each one of the folder enumerated list its amount of contained folders and files.
4) Output all the results to a more or less organized file. 
Currently the only exception is: 
* Temporary-file-cleaner - is an xml file one can import to a local task scheduler in order to automate routine maintenance work on the personal computer. The imported file will schedule a collection of batch commands that delete temporary windows files, cleans "deleted files" and performs small fixes and adjustments to the hard drive.
